GeoStations
=====
GeoStations is a visualization of BART [(Bay Area Rapid Transit)](http://www.bart.gov/) routes using [Google Maps API v3](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial).

Originaly inspired by [CS75 project2](https://www.cs75.net/Projects), the vision of this app is to create a mashup of various transportation APIs and implement them onto one global map.
